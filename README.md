This project is intended to create a survey for BAIS students with style elements along with different modes of collection.

This web form comforms to best practices by utilizing multiple elements to collect answers. Additionally it also uses simple color that are easy to read The background color is also kept simple so that when on the survery, the users eyes are not strained by the colors. I also used a simple font that makes it very easy to read all the text. 

I also did give many options when it came to questions about race as this can be a very sensitive topic and made sure to include an other category for those that did not want to answer or the answer they would like wasn't an option. For the country questions, it was kept as an open format question as this can become a very politcal topic as well. I also made sure to include a welcome page and a thank you page at the end to show appreciation to the user for taking the time to take the survey.

The form has gone through html5 validation to allow for proper use on the laptops. Additionally the website was done through Azure so that it can also be used on mobile devices. There is a website link that can entered into other types of devices as well and the site will show up.
